Good Afternoon!

As you can see, there is a lot of interesting shapes (hint: transform: skew(45deg)) going on in this project. the provided files should be everything you need, but if there is something i left out please don't hesitate to ask. the first page in the PDF is showing the static state of the website, and the second page on the PDF demonstrates how the nav and the panels will react to the mouse hover affect. note: each panel will interact independently (i have included a small demo video of how it can work, not required to act the same way though, that was just my spin on it). You should be able to copy text from the PDF file if needed. you can start with the code from the demo icon font file. I would like to see the project made responsive to work on multiple screen sizes. if you can do a sticky header & navigation that would be great, once again though if not, thats ok (the ocozzio.com website has an sticky header and nav). do what you can. The two images starting with 'para_' i would like to have a parallax affect if you can.

The time frame for this project is up-to one week from when you get it. please keep in mind that for a project like this in Ocozzio, the real deadline would be more like two days while juggling other projects. 

Happy Coding!
